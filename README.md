# Naive-Search-Vs-Binary-Search
Compare time consumed to get target variable from the list using Na√Øve search and Binary search methodology. 
Both of the mentioned methods are used for finding target number and its index number from the given list. 

Naive Search:
            1. It scans/iterates entire list and ssks if its equal to the target variable
            2. Naive Search does not requie a sorted list 
            3. Both index number and target value can be found using this method


Binary Search:
            1. In Binary search the list is divided based on the midpoint rule (we can set the midpoint for dividing the list in parts) and searches the target variable in the list. To do                 so it cut down the iteration of loops. Hece, saving the time
            2. To implement binary search one needs to provide a sorted list 
            3. Both index number and target value can be found using this method




In the attached code, the consumption of time to search from the list is given two  types a. Using loop and selecting current element as target variable, b:Gave specific target number to search  

Using loop method:
In the attached code file a loop is created to select target number from sorted list, loop will select current element as a target and searches in the sorted_list
The loop will continue to take current element as target till the list is exhausted, and comparing the time consumed by both search methodology

Specified target number:
In this the specific target number can be given to code to search it in the list, and compared time consumed by search method
